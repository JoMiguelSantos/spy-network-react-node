# Spy Network React/Node Demo

This is a React/Node Web App I've built while doing my Full Stack Development Bootcamp at SPICED Academy in Berlin.

You can find it deployed in Heroku -> https://spy-network.herokuapp.com/

It uses AWS S3 bucket for image storage and PostgreSQL as Database. I implemented also a general Chat and private Chat funcionality using Socket.io.
